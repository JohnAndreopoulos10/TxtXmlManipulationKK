XML Management Exercise

Due to unexpected technical complications, the project had to be reworked within a shorter timeframe than planned 
and is thus presented in a more "raw" form than intended.
Despite this, the key functionalities required have been implemented, with the following details:

Parser (TXT to XML): Successfully converts a text file into a structured XML document.
Reader and Writer for XML Files: Can read and write XML files as required.
Selective XML Creation: Generates an XML file containing selected paragraphs from an existing XML.
Statistics Generation: Provides statistics based on the contents of the XML, such as paragraph count, 
line count, word count, distinct word count, and more.
XSD Generation: An XSD schema is generated for the XML structure.
Validator: [Pending Completion] The XML-to-XSD validation is currently not functional due to time constraints.

All other functionalities are fully integrated and operational. However, due to limited time, 
the validator could not be completed, and proper logging and Javadoc documentation are also not implemented.
